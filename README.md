## About the Repository

This repository serves as a portfolio of my work in Full Stack Java development. Each project highlights different aspects of the skills I acquired during the SkillDzire program. You will find a range of applications, from simple REST APIs to complex full-stack solutions.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies are used throughout the projects in this repository:

- **Java**: The primary programming language for backend development.
- **Spring Boot**: A framework that simplifies the setup of new Spring applications.
- **Spring Security**: A powerful and customizable authentication and access control framework.
- **Maven**: A build automation tool used primarily for Java projects.
- **MySQL**: A relational database management system for storing application data.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for securely transmitting information between parties.
- **API Development**: Focus on creating RESTful services for seamless communication.

## Project Structure

Each project is organized in a similar manner to ensure consistency. Hereâ€™s a typical structure:

```
/project-name
    â”œâ”€â”€ src
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main
    â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ java
    â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ resources
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test
    â”œâ”€â”€ pom.xml
    â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

- **src**: Contains the source code and resources.
- **pom.xml**: The Maven configuration file.
- **README.md**: Documentation for the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with any project in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/kevin17839/SkillDzire-x-ST-Full-Stack-Java-25.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```
   cd project-name
   ```

3. **Build the Project**:
   ```
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

## How to Use

After running the application, you can interact with the APIs through tools like Postman or curl. Each project includes a detailed README file that outlines the available endpoints and how to use them.

### Example API Request

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to make a GET request to one of the endpoints:

```
GET http://localhost:8080/api/example
```

### Authentication

If the project requires authentication, you will typically need to include a JWT token in the header of your requests. Refer to the specific project documentation for details on obtaining a token.

## Features

Each project may have unique features, but here are some common functionalities:

- **User Registration and Login**: Secure user authentication.
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities for resources.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different access levels for users based on their roles.
- **Data Validation**: Ensure data integrity through validation rules.
